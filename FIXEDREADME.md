Question 2: 
I fixed this question almost correctly. One thing I needed to have changed is in the first JOIN statement I could have specified each column name and from what table the boohbah_id’s are being compared.
But my code outputs the same as the correct one because the column name boohbah_id is the same in the tables. 

Question 9:
I did not fix this question correctly. Logically mine doesn't work because it just simplifies it but doesn't answer the question by fixing the error. 
The original code did not have the columns lined up and doesn't check and compare every row to find the exact boohbah_id and stand_id pairs. 

Question 10: 
I did not fix this question correctly. I only updated the boohbahs that have a connected stand while I was supposed to update all boohbahs in the boohbah_stand_link table.
In my code I also set the energy levels to 999 instead of incrementing/adding it because I didn't add the 999 I just put it there which SQL takes as changing/overwriting to 999.
The correct code would change more rows than mine as well because it doesn't specify that the boohbahs have to have a connected stand link.
